# Technical Assessments and Interviews Practice Questions

Author: Lee Jia Sheng

Last updated: 30 Aug 2023

I have compiled the list of questions that I have solved / am going to attempt as practice questions for my upcoming technical assessment(s) and/or interviews. Most of the questions will be taken from LeetCode and some of them come from HackerRank.

The questions below are categorised based on the data structures and algorithsm used to solve them. It's possible that they might have alternative solution which uses another category of data structures or a different paradigm of algorithms. In fact, these categories are not mutually exclusive.

(I'm quite occupied recently and don't really have time to compile all the interesting questions here. I'll try to update this list on a best-effort basis.)

## Overview
1. Basic data structures: List, Stack, Queue, Priority Queue 
2. Searching and Sorting 
3. Divide and Conquer
4. Hashing
5. Tree
6. Graph
7. Greedy Algorithms
8. Dynamic Programming
9. Others: Sliding Window
